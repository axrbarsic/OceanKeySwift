# Flutter Parity Plan

## Rule

The Flutter application in `/Users/alex/Developer/OceanKeyFlutterRun` is the
visual and behavioral reference while the native iOS rewrite is still catching
up. Do not edit the Flutter project during the port.

All validation for this track targets the physical iPhone. Do not use the iOS
Simulator unless explicitly allowed.

## Transfer Order

1. Main summary screen
   - Header count strip and left/right controls.
   - Cart header: `Тележка N` on the left, territory/building on the right.
   - Room cell status colors, spacing, typography, S/L/B task controls.
   - Right swipe action menu, one open menu by default.
   - Room timeline chips and schedule badge.

2. Room cell domain behavior
   - Open/yellow/red/blue/green/pink status rules.
   - Milestone timestamps: selected, opened, stripped, linen, balcony, done.
   - Scheduled room transition behavior.
   - VIP state and effects.
   - Cart selection rules: carts 1-10, A/B floors 2-5, duplicate-room blocking,
     and workday lock/unlock.

3. Notes and media
   - Text notes.
   - Voice notes with transcription.
   - Photo and video capture with local-only storage.
   - Full-screen vertical media viewer.

4. Cart details
   - Long press on cart header opens cart-specific details.
   - Cart notes, consumables placeholder, photo/video capture.
   - Completion markers and timestamps.

5. Settings and diagnostics
   - Developer diagnostics.
   - Build/version changelog.
   - Visual effect settings only after the native effect runtime is stable.

6. Persistence and sync
   - Local-first storage.
   - Apple-first sync evaluation through iCloud/CloudKit.
   - Firebase is not a Swift migration target.

## Current Native Checkpoint

- Native migration rule is now explicit: copy the product idea, workflow,
  domain rules, and visual contract from Flutter, but implement each feature
  using professional Swift/iOS architecture rather than mirroring Flutter widget
  structure or lifecycle.
- SpriteKit/GameplayKit effect host exists.
- Main screen uses a SpriteKit Matrix background.
- Room cells now use the Flutter status palette.
- Room cells support open state, S/L/B task toggles, VIP toggle, schedule toggle,
  timeline fields, schedule badge, and a right-swipe action menu.
- Only one action menu is open at a time.
- Native state now loads from and saves to a local JSON repository in Application
  Support. This is the first local-first source-of-truth layer for the Swift
  rewrite.
- Header settings opens a native Settings screen with developer/build info and
  local storage status.
- Room details text notes and voice-transcript drafts are now domain data and
  persist through the local work-session repository.
- Long press on a cart header opens a native cart details screen with persistent
  cart note, consumables placeholder, and media action slots.
- Cart details media can capture local-only photos/videos through the native
  camera bridge, stores files in Application Support, and shows vertical
  thumbnail previews.
- Room swipe menu now opens the same native local media capture flow for room
  photo/video attachments.
- Settings now includes an in-app build changelog so installed builds can be
  identified without reading Git history.
- Deliberate visual exception: native Swift room cells use the taller first-test
  geometry (`76pt` tile height and wider `10pt` inter-cell spacing) because it
  looked better on iPhone than the tighter Flutter parity geometry.
- Settings can now switch room-cell geometry between the taller first-test Swift
  layout and the tighter Flutter-parity layout.
- Scheduled pink rooms now advance automatically to open/red on the main screen
  when the scheduled time has arrived, recording the opened timestamp and
  persisting the change locally.
- Native domain rules now cover room catalog, cart bindings, room selection,
  blocked duplicate rooms, workday lock/unlock, and summary cart rebuilding.
- Native first work setup screen now lets the user choose carts, A/B building,
  floor, and rooms before locking into the summary screen.
- Settings can unlock the workday and return to setup editing after the summary
  screen is already active.
- Local persistence now writes a work-session snapshot containing selection and
  carts together, while still reading older cart-list JSON files.
- Core room task invariants now require an open room before S/L/B changes, and
  ready status requires open plus all tasks.
- Native interaction feedback now mirrors the Flutter foundation: UIKit haptics,
  bundled click/pressed WAV sounds, ambient mixed audio, protected long-press
  room controls by default, and clean haptic feedback for right-swipe menus.
- Room long-press haptics are delayed so normal vertical scrolling across cells
  does not buzz or steal intent; right-swipe menu arming now requires a stronger
  horizontal gesture.
- The summary header puzzle handle is functional again: dragging the puzzle
  returns from the main screen to first-screen cart/room editing.
- Room scheduling now uses a native hour/minute/AM-PM sheet with 15-minute
  increments, pink schedule status priority, automatic due-time opening, and
  local iOS notifications.
- Room voice notes and cart notes now share native Russian speech-to-text
  transcription through `Speech` and `AVAudioEngine`; Gemini is not part of the
  Swift voice path.
- Voice recording startup is hardened on real devices: Speech and microphone
  permission callbacks stay outside MainActor isolation, and audio-engine tap
  cleanup avoids duplicate removal/finish paths.
- Repeated voice recordings now run through an explicit capture state machine
  with a fresh `AVAudioEngine` per session, preventing overlapping input taps
  during rapid start/stop cycles.
- Voice transcription is now split into an iOS-native `VoiceTranscriptionService`
  and `VoiceNoteViewModel`; the SwiftUI panel no longer owns AVFoundation or
  Speech lifecycle directly.
- Sync direction is Apple-first for the native rewrite. Firebase should not be
  used as the architecture reference for Swift sync.
