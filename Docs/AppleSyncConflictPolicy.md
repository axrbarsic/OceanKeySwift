# Apple Sync Conflict Policy

## Goal

Native iCloud sync must be local-first and idempotent. A local edit on one
iPhone should appear on another iPhone quickly, but an older cloud import must
not erase fresher local room or cart work.

## Unit Of Merge

Merge small domain records, not one whole-day blob:

- Workday selection lock state.
- Cart binding and selected room membership.
- Room fields: opened state, S/L/B tasks, VIP flag, scheduled time.
- Room timeline milestones: selected, opened, stripped, linen, balcony, done.
- Room notes, voice transcript, and local media metadata.
- Cart notes, consumables, and local media metadata.
- Event history entries.

Local media files stay device-local unless a later product decision changes
that. Sync may move media metadata, but not photo/video bytes.

## Ordering

Every mutable domain field needs an update timestamp. Merge compares the field's
timestamp, not only the containing cart or work-session timestamp.

Current native coverage includes room open state, S/L/B task state, VIP state,
and scheduled room time as explicit field-timestamped values, alongside
existing room milestone, note, media, cart note, and cart consumable timestamps.

Default rule:

- Newer field timestamp wins.
- Equal timestamp keeps the local value, so repeated imports are idempotent.
- Missing remote timestamp never overwrites a local timestamped field.
- Unknown remote fields are ignored until the app version knows how to read
  them.

## Milestones

Room timeline milestones are facts. Do not delete a milestone just because a
remote snapshot is missing it.

Default rule:

- If one side has a milestone and the other does not, keep the existing
  milestone.
- If both sides have the same milestone, keep the earlier timestamp for
  "first happened" events such as selected/opened/stripped/linen/balcony/done.
- A status rollback must be represented by a new explicit command, not by
  removing old milestone facts during merge.

## Room Status

Room visual status is derived from fields after merge:

- Scheduled time has priority until it becomes due.
- Ready requires opened plus all S/L/B tasks.
- In-progress requires any S/L/B task.
- Open requires opened.
- Pending is the fallback.

Merge should not store a separate color/status field that can drift from the
rules above.

## Event History

History entries are append-only and identified by stable event IDs.

Default rule:

- Union by event ID.
- Preserve happened-at timestamps.
- Keep lightweight visual snapshots for reading history on the move.
- Never use history replay as the only source of current room state; current
  state is merged from the domain records above.

## Safety Gate

Before enabling iCloud for installed builds:

- The app must have field-level timestamps for every mutable synced field.
- Cloud imports must enter through the repository boundary, not directly into
  SwiftUI views.
- Two-device tests must cover same-room edits, schedule due transitions, cart
  consumables, notes, and history union.
- The fallback path must keep the app usable local-only if iCloud is disabled,
  unavailable, or signed out.
