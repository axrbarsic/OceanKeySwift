# Apple-First Sync Plan

## Decision

The native Swift rewrite does not migrate the Flutter Firebase sync stack.
Firebase is treated as old-platform infrastructure, not as an architecture
reference for the Swift app.

The Swift app keeps a local-first domain/repository boundary. Apple sync will
be added behind that boundary after the domain model and input flow are stable.

## Official Apple Direction

- CloudKit private database is the target for per-user iCloud data. Apple
  documents `CKDatabase` as the API surface for private, public, and shared
  databases: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckdatabase
- For Core Data-backed apps, `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` can mirror a local
  persistent store to CloudKit: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple documents that `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` uses local persistent
  history to export local saves and import remote changes:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3163-understanding-the-synchronization-of-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple also documents sync debugging through Xcode logs/sysdiagnose:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3164-debugging-the-synchronization-of-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer

## Architecture

1. Keep domain logic independent from CloudKit.
   - Room catalog.
   - Cart binding and room selection.
   - Room status/timeline/schedule/VIP rules.
   - Notes/media metadata.
   - Workday snapshots and event history.

2. Keep local persistence as the source of immediate truth.
   - UI updates optimistically from local state.
   - Sync never directly drives SwiftUI screens.
   - Remote changes enter through a repository/importer.

3. Add Apple sync as an infrastructure adapter.
   - Preferred first candidate: SwiftData's managed CloudKit path, because
     SwiftData uses the same CloudKit machinery behind the scenes while keeping
     the repository boundary native.
   - Keep the persisted SwiftData model compatible with CloudKit: don't rely on
     local-only uniqueness constraints, and keep relationships optional so
     CloudKit can process related changes in its own order.
   - Current AI visual preset drafts are stored as lightweight JSON in a
     separate SwiftData store configured for private CloudKit sync through
     `iCloud.com.alex.oceankey.swift`.
   - The preset store must report its real storage mode. If CloudKit store
     creation fails, UI must show local fallback instead of implying that
     Apple sync is active.
   - As of 2026-06-10, physical-device signing is blocked because the local
     provisioning profile `iOS Team Provisioning Profile:
     com.alex.oceankey.swift` contains neither `aps-environment` nor
     `com.apple.developer.icloud-*` entitlements and does not support the
     `iCloud.com.alex.oceankey.swift` container.
   - Build 103 keeps real CloudKit entitlements limited to simulator/future
     validation so physical iPhone installs keep working with Alex's Personal
     Team profile. AI/live-wallpaper preset protection is therefore a manual
     Files export path for now: the app writes a lightweight JSON backup
     document with preset/config data, and Alex can save that document to
     iCloud Drive through the system exporter.
   - To unblock real iPhone sync, enable iCloud/CloudKit and Push Notifications
     for App ID `com.alex.oceankey.swift`, attach/create container
     `iCloud.com.alex.oceankey.swift`, regenerate/download the development
     provisioning profile, then run the device build again with
     `-allowProvisioningUpdates`.
   - `SwiftDataWorkSessionRepository.SyncMode` is now the explicit boundary for
     that future switch; default app construction still uses `.localOnly`.
   - Merge/conflict rules are tracked in `Docs/AppleSyncConflictPolicy.md` and
     must be treated as the contract before enabling real iCloud sync.
   - Fallback candidate: direct CloudKit `CKRecord`/custom zones if event log
     ordering and conflict rules need explicit control.

4. Sync only lightweight domain data.
   - Room/cart state, timestamps, notes, settings, history entries, visual
     snapshots.
   - Local-only media files unless a later product decision changes this.
   - AI-generated live wallpaper and VIP effect presets are config/code
     payloads, not video files. Backups should store those lightweight
     definitions plus current background settings, not rendered media.

## Readiness Gate

Before implementing CloudKit:

- Domain commands are covered by tests.
- The first input screen creates the same work-session state as the summary
  screen consumes.
- Legacy JSON has been upgraded behind the repository boundary; SwiftData can
  import existing local JSON without losing current installs.
- SwiftData schema is CloudKit-ready at the model-shape level, and the app now
  requests CloudKit sync by default through the repository boundary.
- The repository can now accept a future private CloudKit container identifier
  through a sync-mode parameter, while tests keep this path isolated from real
  iCloud by forcing in-memory storage to local-only.
- `Docs/AppleSyncConflictPolicy.md` documents the two-iPhone conflict policy.
