# Apple-First Sync Plan

## Decision

The native Swift rewrite does not migrate the Flutter Firebase sync stack.
Firebase is treated as old-platform infrastructure, not as an architecture
reference for the Swift app.

The Swift app keeps a local-first domain/repository boundary. Apple sync will
be added behind that boundary after the domain model and input flow are stable.

## Official Apple Direction

- CloudKit private database is the target for per-user iCloud data. Apple
  documents `CKDatabase` as the API surface for private, public, and shared
  databases: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckdatabase
- For Core Data-backed apps, `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` can mirror a local
  persistent store to CloudKit: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple documents that `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` uses local persistent
  history to export local saves and import remote changes:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3163-understanding-the-synchronization-of-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple also documents sync debugging through Xcode logs/sysdiagnose:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3164-debugging-the-synchronization-of-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer

## Architecture

1. Keep domain logic independent from CloudKit.
   - Room catalog.
   - Cart binding and room selection.
   - Room status/timeline/schedule/VIP rules.
   - Notes/media metadata.
   - Workday snapshots and event history.

2. Keep local persistence as the source of immediate truth.
   - UI updates optimistically from local state.
   - Sync never directly drives SwiftUI screens.
   - Remote changes enter through a repository/importer.

3. Add Apple sync as an infrastructure adapter.
   - Preferred first candidate: Core Data plus
     `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`, if the model maps cleanly.
   - Fallback candidate: direct CloudKit `CKRecord`/custom zones if event log
     ordering and conflict rules need explicit control.

4. Sync only lightweight domain data.
   - Room/cart state, timestamps, notes, settings, snapshots.
   - Local-only media files unless a later product decision changes this.

## Readiness Gate

Before implementing CloudKit:

- Domain commands are covered by tests.
- The first input screen creates the same work-session state as the summary
  screen consumes.
- Local JSON can be upgraded or replaced without losing current installs.
- A documented conflict policy exists for two iPhones editing the same workday.
