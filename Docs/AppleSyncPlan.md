# Apple-First Sync Plan

## Decision

The native Swift rewrite does not migrate the Flutter Firebase sync stack.
Firebase is treated as old-platform infrastructure, not as an architecture
reference for the Swift app.

The Swift app keeps a local-first domain/repository boundary. Apple sync will
be added behind that boundary after the domain model and input flow are stable.

## Official Apple Direction

- CloudKit private database is the target for per-user iCloud data. Apple
  documents `CKDatabase` as the API surface for private, public, and shared
  databases: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckdatabase
- For Core Data-backed apps, `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` can mirror a local
  persistent store to CloudKit: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple documents that `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` uses local persistent
  history to export local saves and import remote changes:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3163-understanding-the-synchronization-of-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer
- Apple also documents sync debugging through Xcode logs/sysdiagnose:

## Architecture

1. Keep domain logic independent from CloudKit.
   - Room catalog.
   - Cart binding and room selection.
   - Room status/timeline/schedule/VIP rules.
   - Notes/media metadata.
   - Workday snapshots and event history.

2. Keep local persistence as the source of immediate truth.
   - UI updates optimistically from local state.
   - Sync never directly drives SwiftUI screens.
   - Remote changes enter through a repository/importer.

3. Add Apple sync as an infrastructure adapter.
   - Preferred first candidate: SwiftData's managed CloudKit path, because
     SwiftData uses the same CloudKit machinery behind the scenes while keeping
     the repository boundary native.
   - Keep the persisted SwiftData model compatible with CloudKit: don't rely on
     local-only uniqueness constraints, and keep relationships optional so
     CloudKit can process related changes in its own order.
   - Current installed builds keep SwiftData explicitly local-only until iCloud
     entitlements/container setup and conflict policy are enabled deliberately.
   - Fallback candidate: direct CloudKit `CKRecord`/custom zones if event log
     ordering and conflict rules need explicit control.

4. Sync only lightweight domain data.
   - Room/cart state, timestamps, notes, settings, snapshots.
   - Local-only media files unless a later product decision changes this.

## Readiness Gate

Before implementing CloudKit:

- Domain commands are covered by tests.
- The first input screen creates the same work-session state as the summary
  screen consumes.
- Legacy JSON has been upgraded behind the repository boundary; SwiftData can
  import existing local JSON without losing current installs.
- SwiftData schema is CloudKit-ready at the model-shape level, but the active
  store remains local-only until sync is intentionally enabled.
- A documented conflict policy exists for two iPhones editing the same workday.
