                "Added native domain rules for room catalog, cart binding, room selection, duplicate blocking, and workday locking.",
                "Moved local persistence to a work-session snapshot that stores selection and carts together, with legacy cart-list restore support.",
                "Aligned core room task invariants: S/L/B require an open room and ready status requires open plus all tasks.",
                "Documented Apple-first iCloud/CloudKit sync direction; Firebase is not a Swift migration target.",
                "Scheduled pink rooms now automatically become open/red when their time arrives.",
                "Added a settings switch between taller first-test cells and compact Flutter-parity cells.",
                "Restored the taller first-test room-cell geometry as a deliberate Swift-only visual exception.",
                "Native Swift rewrite runs on physical iPhone with SpriteKit Matrix background.",
                "Main screen has cart sections, room cells, S/L/B actions, VIP, schedule, and one-open swipe menu.",
                "Room and cart state now persists locally through Application Support JSON storage.",
                "Room text notes, voice transcript drafts, cart notes, and local photo/video attachments are domain data.",
